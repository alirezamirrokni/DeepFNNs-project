# DeepFNNs Project

This repository contains two deep learning projects that aim to predict user behavior in different domains: hotel bookings and airline customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

1. **Hotel Booking Prediction**: This project builds a model to predict whether a user will book a hotel based on search behavior and related features. The model analyzes user search data to forecast bookings, enabling personalized offers.

2. **Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction**: This project predicts customer satisfaction with airline services based on survey data, using various flight-related features.
