This repository contains two deep learning projects aimed at predicting user behavior in different domains: hotel booking and customer satisfaction in the airline industry.

Part 1: Hotel Booking Prediction
In the first part of this project, the goal is to build a model that predicts whether a user will book a hotel based on their search behavior and other related features. Users typically visit hotel booking websites, search for hotels, and may or may not complete a booking. By analyzing this data, we aim to predict whether a user will book a hotel after searching, allowing us to personalize offers, such as discounts or alternative hotel suggestions.

Part 2: Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction
The second part focuses on predicting customer satisfaction with airline services based on survey data. Customer feedback is crucial for improving services, and this project aims to predict whether a customer is satisfied or not using a variety of features related to their flight experience.
